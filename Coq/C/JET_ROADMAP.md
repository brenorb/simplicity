# Every-jet implementation-to-specification goal

Prove every individual public C jet equivalent to its Simplicity program,
including application primitives. Mathematical properties of the specifications
and helper correctness alone do not count as jet coverage. No proof escapes,
new axioms or pushes. Reuse completed proofs and proceed easiest to hardest.

## Scope and status

The public surface currently has 533 distinct declarations: 370 in `C/jets.h`,
60 in `C/bitcoin/bitcoinJets.h`, 103 in `C/elements/elementsJets.h`.
`../jet-coverage.py` derives this inventory from those headers and both
`primitiveJetNode.inc` registration catalogs, rather than maintaining a fixed
list of missing jets. `jet_coverage.tsv` maps completed functions to audited,
named canonical implementation-to-specification theorems. It is bookkeeping,
not an independent proof checker; `../check-jets.sh` builds and checks proofs.

There are 51 covered core jets: one/increment/add at 8/16/32/64 bits,
low/high/complement/and/or/xor at 1/8/16/32/64 bits, and maj/xor_xor/ch at
16/32/64 bits. There are 482 declarations without coverage
entries, including all Bitcoin and Elements jets. Coverage is for the pinned
PRODUCTION LP64 Clight configuration, not other ABIs or debug builds.

Two core declarations are not registered in either application catalog:
`simplicity_off_curve_scale` and `simplicity_off_curve_linear_combination_1`.
Keep them visible. Resolve their intended specifications or obsolete status
explicitly; do not quietly exclude them to obtain a complete count.

Commands from the repository root:

```sh
python3 Coq/jet-coverage.py
python3 Coq/jet-coverage.py --csv
python3 Coq/jet-coverage.py --require-complete
opam exec --switch=simplicity -- bash Coq/check-jets.sh --ast
```

The completeness command intentionally fails while any declaration lacks a
proof entry. Passing the normal checks certifies existing proofs, not completion
of the every-jet goal. Nix uses the same gates and supplies the C inventory
through `Simplicity.JetInventory.nix` / `JET_C_REPO`, because its proof source
tree otherwise contains only Coq files.

## Reusable proof structure and next families

1. **Constants: completed.** `jet_constant.v` isolates actual function
   selectors, canonical programs, literal evaluations/casts and representation
   bridges. `jet_constant_exec.v` composes function entry, the generated body,
   return conversion and freeing locals. `jet_constant_writer.v` unifies the
   existing total bit/byte/wide writers. `jet_constant_layout.v` derives all
   intermediate allocations and stores from initial contracts, exports ten
   canonical local specs, and reuses context and call-boundary guarantees.
   The bridges compute closed constants only; symbolic memory is not unfolded.
2. **Complement and binary and/or/xor: completed.** Five complement calls
   reuse total readers/writers, frame lifecycle, canonical encodings,
   contexts and guarantees. `jet_complement_spec.v` defines the exact canonical
   recursion (base `Bit.not iden`, successor `take rec &&& drop rec`). Its
   symbolic bridge uses `Word.testbitToZLo` / `Word.testbitToZHi` by induction,
   followed by `Int.bits_not` / `Int64.bits_not`, accounting for truncation.
   `Word.bitwiseTri_correct` cannot prove complement: its zero-preservation
   premise is false for negation. `jet_readBit_layout.v` now proves both actual
   bit-reader bodies at arbitrary layouts, including the exact returned bit
   and cursor increment. Reuse it for one-bit variants and carry-input jets.
   Fifteen binary calls use `jet_binary_spec.v`, which mirrors the canonical
   `Programs.Word.bitwise_bin` recursion exactly and proves shared symbolic
   bit bridges for both CompCert carriers. `jet_binary_wide_exec.v` and
   `jet_binary_wide_layout.v` parameterize the operation and W16/W32/W64.
   `jet_binary8_*.v` account for promotions and truncation; `jet_binary1_*.v`
   execute the actual and/or conditional branches and the XOR expression.
   All adapters derive two readers and one writer from initial contracts,
   and export canonical/context/call-boundary results. Both inputs are read
   even in the one-bit and/or bodies. Reuse the shared bit-preservation lemma
   and these sequencing proofs for subsequent readers.
   **Wide ternary operations completed.** Nine maj/xor_xor/ch calls reuse
   Coq Word's existing `bitwiseTri` and `bitwiseTri_correct`: the recursion
   and Bit.maj/xor3/ch bases were checked against the canonical Haskell
   programs. `jet_ternary_spec.v` supplies closed symbolic bridges for both
   CompCert carriers, preserving the actual multiply-by-one in ch.
   `jet_ternary_wide_exec.v` shares the binary reader-call adapter and a new
   long-expression lemma. `jet_ternary_wide_layout.v` derives three reads,
   one write and the complete frame lifecycle, exporting canonical, context
   and call-boundary results. `frame_input_word_triple_encode` bridges the
   nested canonical input product to its three physical word contracts.
   Next: ternary 8-bit and 1-bit adapters, then predicates and comparisons.
   Reuse the shared bridges and input encoding; keep byte promotions and
   boolean branching separate from uniform wide operations.
   For the byte adapters, reuse `binary8_read` / `call_binary8_read` with
   `_t'1`, `_t'2`, `_t'3`. The maj/xor_xor intermediates are `tint`, but ch's
   multiply/negation/second-and/final-or are `tuint`; its first-and is `tint`.
   Prove those actual promotions before using `ternary_int_denotes`, and
   truncate only through the actual writer's byte cast. Use
   `frame_input_word_triple_encode` and `byte_slice_at_encode` for input,
   exposing the non-wrapping 24-bit consumption bound.
   For the one-bit adapters, reuse `binary1_read` / `call_binary1_read`,
   `eval_readBit_layout`, `eval_writeBit_layout` and single-bit preservation.
   Inspect all generated conditional subtrees: all three bits are read first,
   and boolean results must be normalized to `bit_int`. Small Boolean case
   analysis is appropriate here; do not enumerate larger words or unfold
   symbolic memory. Existing integer bridges alone do not prove these calls.
3. **Arithmetic families.** Subtraction/decrement and carry-input variants
   should reuse the increment/add machine-value, carry and word-modulo facts.
   Keep width-independent arithmetic separate from generated-body adapters.
   Afterwards tackle shifts/rotates, multiplication, division and larger widths.
4. **Failure-capable jets.** Extend the current success-only `jet_local_spec`
   infrastructure with a contract tied to the Simplicity assertion semantics,
   covering both return values and the permitted memory effects on failure.
   The inventory's theorem-shape validation must be extended explicitly for
   that contract. Do not force partial specifications into a total function or
   assume away failures merely to reuse the current predicate.
5. **Hashing, secp256k1 and application primitives.** Reuse the library and
   existing cryptographic verification lemmas where they actually apply.
   `Simplicity/SHA256.v:hashBlock_correct` connects a Simplicity term to VST's
   functional SHA model, not the full generated C jet call; it is support for
   a future C-to-Simplicity proof, not an additional covered jet. Likewise,
   committed `jets_secp256k1.v` avoids one AST-generation step but does not
   itself establish jet equivalence. Check artifact provenance and configuration
   before using it. Bitcoin/Elements require concrete environment representations,
   their primitive semantics, failures and suitable generated C artifacts.

## Verification and completion discipline

Public results must quantify over valid non-wrapping layouts and cursors,
arbitrary unrelated output bits, and the required environments. Derive helper
execution, cursor changes and allocation/copy/store/free obligations from the
initial state. Preserve permitted memory framing. The context layer is reusable
but whole-evaluator linking is not required by this individual-jet goal.

Add modules to both project manifests, public results to the theorem audit,
and specifications/selectors/contracts to the definition snapshot. Review
assumption and contract changes before accepting updated expectations. New
proofs must preserve previous theorem types and axiom sets. Build consumers
after dependency edits: a stale `.vo` is not evidence about changed source.

The constant extension exposed a negative-test fixture bug: mutating
`jet_guarantees.v` requires rebuilding its consumers before comparing contracts.
The harness now does so; the impossible-premise test must fail because the
contract changed, not because Coq rejected an inconsistent artifact digest.
The complement extension also exposed pretty-print wrapping of long `Locate`
names in the assumption audit. The gate now uses explicit theorem-name markers
and checks missing results before either comparison or snapshot update. It does
not expand the inherited axiom allowlist.

Completion requires inspecting the full inventory, actual theorem statements,
source/Clight correspondence, supported configurations and checked assumptions.
Do not mark the goal complete based only on the subset currently in the public
build or on the coverage metadata alone.
